#### Brief Description of Project - 

We are developing a Garment Factory Management System for Lakshika Fashion Garments PVT LTD,
Yakkala. The garment factory which we selected is a mid-size enterprise and they are expecting to expand
their business. Their business module is buying raw clothing material from suppliers, sewing pants and jeans
(trousers, shorts for both ladies and gents) and selling the final product to the customers (Kandy Fashion
Store, Thilakawardana Textile, Sarasavi Textile, Geeza Fashion, etc ). Currently they have ledgers which are
updated manually for each department run by managers (managers of employees, manager of
Transportations, managers of business affairs). Details regarding customers, suppliers, employees,
expenditures, employee attendance, Assets are also stored manually. They have over 50 employees who are
managed by 6 managers.

Our Garment Factory Management System will comprise the following functions:
1)Customer Management: Customers can request an account and place orders through the web application.
2)Supplier Management: Suppliers can confirm the availability of materials for customer orders.
3)HR Management: Streamlined employee management with six managers overseeing 50 employees.
4)Transport Management: Coordination of product transportation to customers.
5)Finance Management: Automated financial operations and payment processing.
6)Work Management: Efficient division of production tasks.( Developed by my self)
7)Resource Management: Optimizing resource utilization.
8)Design Management: Handling design-related aspects of garment production.

By upgrading to an automated system reports can be generated automatically and also instantly with full
accuracy, Storing data is less time consuming than the manual system, the human labor that was being used
for the manual system can Now be used for something else, data stored within the system is safer and it only
takes a very small space to store to details, financial Side can now be handled by the system rather than the
outdated cash or cheques method.
